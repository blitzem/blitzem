# blitzem

# THIS PROJECT IS NOW RETIRED. 
## My main intention when creating this was to provide an idempotent way of provisioning IaaS that could be subsequently configured using tools like Ansible. These tools have advanced considerably and for a while have been capable of doing the provisioning themselves - blitzem is no longer needed. I'd strongly recommend using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/get-started) for future provisioning and configuration needs.
